# Sinyal Bahasa Project
Welcome to Sinyal Bahasa Project from CH2-PS483 Team

## Background Story:
In addressing the critical issue of accessibility and inclusion for the deaf community, particularly those who rely on sign language, we embarked on the development of an innovative application named 'Sinyal (Sarana Informasi Nge-Sibi yang Asik dan Lancar).' Recognizing that over 2,500,000 deaf and Sibi (Sistem Isyarat Bahasa Indonesia) users in Indonesia often face social isolation due to the reliance on verbal communication, we aimed to bridge this gap. Despite existing efforts to create technology for sign language translation, the adoption of such solutions in Indonesia remained suboptimal.
Our team, comprising individuals with varying levels of IT experience, faced the challenges of navigating this new domain. The initial execution deviated from the predefined timeline, but our collective adaptability and improvisation skills allowed us to course-correct effectively, ensuring the project's timely completion. The application, featuring a user-friendly interface, accelerates sign language translation and incorporates engaging mini-games for learning Sibi. The inclusion of an 'events' feature facilitates community interaction between sign language and spoken language users. With the successful development of 'Sinyal Bahasa,' our vision is realizedâ€”a platform of equality fostering learning, development, and empowerment within the deaf community.
